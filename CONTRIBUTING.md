2. Create a new branch.
3. Push your changes.
4. Create Pull Request.

- Make sure to follow the **Code-Style** followed throughout Screna.
- Make use of latest C# features and ReSharper.

### Very Important
If you intend to make a big change, create a Pull Request early and include `(WIP)` in its title.
- So that everyone knows what you are working so that there are no redundancies.
- To know before-hand if what you intend to do goes well with the Roadmap of the project.

> You could still send a Pull Request even if you are uncomfortable with the guidelines.
We would help you to make your code comply with our guidelines.
