.Net Capture Solution to Capture Screen/Audio/Video/Mouse Cursor/KeyStrokes and more...

Screna provides a highly extensible API to develop Capturing Apps.

# News
* Added an FFMpegVideoWriter in Screna.FFMpeg namespace which uses ffmpeg.exe for encoding.

* Extension packages now supply libraries instead of source-code.

* Merged Screna.Lame into Screna.SharpAvi.

* Added a BASS audio library extension for Screna.

* Screna is now composed of a collection of packages, instead of a single one.  
  Main reasons behind this were licensing issues and the mess involved in copying code from other projects into Screna.
